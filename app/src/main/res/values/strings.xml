    <string name="body">I\'m a CS grad that dabbles around in code by night, while having a fulltime bank job by day.
    You can often find me listening to a podcast or watching a classic sitcom on Netflix. I like the outdoors on a good weather day
     but i am more of an indoors person. Procrastination is my arch nemesis, i almost didn\'t code this!</string>
